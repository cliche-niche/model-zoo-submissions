### ResNet
This directory contains two .ipynb files, one being [res.ipynb](./ResNet/res.ipynb) and [resNew.ipynb](./ResNet/resNew.ipynb), both based on [this research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
- res.ipynb was the first attempt to implement it. It yields test accuracy of **53%**
- resNew.ipynb had improvements used from [here](https://keras.io/zh/examples/cifar10_resnet/), but its test accuracy was **66%**.
